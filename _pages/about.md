Hello there!

I'm Jonathan Ma, a junior at Cornell University majoring in CS interested in 
embedded software, robotics, and backend development. I’m particularly passionate about their 
applications to aerospace and autonomous systems. I also love building apps and tools which can help solve problems in people’s daily lives.

I am currently looking for an internship for the summer of 2025 in embedded software, backend development, or robotics. 
Check out my resume and detailed descriptions of my past projects/experiences by exploring the links in the header!

In my free time, I enjoy photography and hiking. I also really like elephants.
